# VBA-challange-
For this project we had to create a script that looped through all the worksheets and their stocks and  and output the following information:
  The ticker symbol.
  The yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year. 
  The total volume of the stock.
We then had to make sure the script had functionality and returned information concerning:
  Greatest Percent Increase
  Greatest Percent Decrease 
  Greatest Total Volume 
Condtional Formatting had to be applied so that the positive changes came up green and the negative changes came up red.
